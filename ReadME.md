# Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is just a place where I am learning about working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file that uses Markup syntax to produce a document tha tohters can read online when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the following:

-How to make repositories
- How to publish a repo using GitHub Desktop
-How to make commits to a repo

Let's give it a go :) Also, try out[ Introduction to GitHub](https://github.io/on-demand) to learn more.
